<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
Your task is to create a function that as input receives an equation in a form of a string with digits, erased places ('#') and one of the three arithmetic operations (+, - or *), for example - "##*##=302#". As a result, your function should return a digit (from the interval 0-9), which when applied instead of all #, made the equation correct. Or -1 (minus one) if this isn’t possible.<br>
<br>
Important note - none of the figures that already are in the equation cannot be in place of #. Also, if after the equal sign (=) there are 2 or more missing symbols, the answer cannot consist of zeros (00, 000, etc.).<br>
Numbers in the format like #n, #nn and so on, where n - any digit, can't start with 0. For example, "#9+3=12" == -1.<br>
In case there are several suitable digits - use the smallest of them.
Еhe numbers in the formula can be both positive (for example, "1+1=#") and negative, with the "-" sign before them ("19--45=5#", "-1*-6=#").
